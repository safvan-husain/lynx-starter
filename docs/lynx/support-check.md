To determine if an npm package is supportable in Lynx (ReactLynx), inspect its source code for dependencies on unsupported browser APIs, Node.js modules, or React Native-specific bridges. Lynx runs in a custom runtime embedded in native apps, supporting React 17 APIs but lacking full browser/Node environments.

Step-by-Step Check
Review package.json: Look for native dependencies (react-native-*, @react-native-async-storage, platform-specific libs) or peer deps beyond React 17/Preact—these often need custom native modules.

Scan source code (src/lib/index.js): Search for unsupported globals like window.document, process, fs, module, require('react-native'), WebSocket, or DOM APIs (e.g., addEventListener on non-Lynx elements). Lynx uses NativeModules for native access instead.
​

Check for threading/callbacks: Flag setTimeout with DOM ops, Web Workers, or non-Lynx refs—Lynx has main/background threads via runOnMainThread/runOnBackground.
​

Test pure JS libs: State/data tools (Zustand, Jotai) work if no env deps; UI libs need Lynx components (e.g., <View> not div).

# Compatibility

This article explains how to ensure version compatibility between [Bundle] and [Lynx Engine], and how to handle challenges that come with Lynx Engine version evolution.

## Build from Source

A simple way to ensure compatibility is to **always build the Bundle with the Host application from source**.

- Bundle can fully utilize all features of the current Lynx Engine version
- Compatibility can be fully verified during development, what you see is what you get

## Multi-version Compatibility

However, in a complex project, the relationship between Bundle and Lynx Engine is not one-to-one:

- A Bundle might run in applications with different Lynx Engine versions

- An application can run multiple Bundles maintained by different teams

In this case, you need to set the [`engineVersion`] to ensure compatibility.

:::info Engine Version
When the Bundle's [`engineVersion`] is greater than the Lynx Engine version, it will not be able to run.
:::

For example: a Bundle with [`engineVersion`] 3.3 can run on Lynx Engine 3.3 and later versions, but cannot run on 3.2.

          E11["Version 3.4"]

          E09["Version 3.2"]
      end

When a Bundle needs to run on multiple Lynx Engine versions, its [`engineVersion`] must be lower than all Lynx Engine versions.

When running multiple Bundles on a single Lynx Engine version, each Bundle can set different [`engineVersion`]s, but none can be greater than the Lynx Engine version.

### Version Incompatibility Handling

If you try to run a Bundle on a lower version of the Lynx Engine, a Fatal level error with code [10204](/api/errors/error-code.md#subcode-10204) will occur, and the rendering process will stop. This mechanism prevents potential runtime issues caused by version incompatibility.

### Configuring Engine Version

The [`engineVersion`] is a string containing two version numbers, and you can specify it in your configuration file:

```js title="lynx.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from '@lynx-js/rspeedy';
import { pluginReactLynx } from '@lynx-js/react-rsbuild-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    pluginReactLynx({
      engineVersion: '3.2',
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Upgrading Lynx Engine

As Lynx Engine evolves, new features are added and some features may be deprecated. Their compatibility is also managed by [`engineVersion`].

### New Features

Some new features **_will not_** affect existing Bundles, but if [`engineVersion`] is lower than the version where they were introduced, runtime detection is needed, for example:

```js
// Detect if `lynx.newlyAddedMethod` can be called
if (lynx.newlyAddedMethod) {
  lynx.newlyAddedMethod();
}
```

While some new features cannot run on lower versions of the Lynx Engine at all, so they will only be enabled when [`engineVersion`] is greater than or equal to the corresponding version.

### Deprecated Features

Some features may be deprecated during iteration, and their behavior may change when a higher [`engineVersion`] is set.

- If only the Lynx Engine version is upgraded without upgrading the Bundle's [`engineVersion`], there will be no compatibility issues
- If both Lynx Engine and Bundle's [`engineVersion`] are upgraded, you need to read the CHANGELOG to ensure there are no unexpected behavior changes

## API Compatibility

Lynx provides comprehensive compatibility information for each API, built-in component, and CSS property. We offer two paired components to help you understand platform support:

### APISummary

The `<APISummary />` component provides a quick, high-level overview of an API's availability across platforms. It shows a summary status (e.g., "Widely available") and badges for supported platforms. Clicking on this summary card will automatically jump to the detailed compatibility table.

### APITable

The `<APITable />` component displays detailed, version-specific support information for each platform. It breaks down support by OS (Android, iOS) and Web, including specific version numbers where applicable.

### Interactive Explorer

Use the interactive explorer below to search and discover compatibility information using both components:

- **CSS Properties**: Enter paths like `css/properties/gap`
- **Built-in Elements**: Enter paths like `elements/view` to see element compatibility
- **Nested APIs**: Use dot notation to access nested identifiers, e.g., `css/properties/align-self.supported_in_flex_layout`
